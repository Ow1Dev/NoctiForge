# NoctiForge

**NoctiForge** is a self-hosted function runtime that lets you focus on writing codeâ€”not managing infrastructure.

Just write a handler. NoctiForge handles the rest.

# Usage
NoctiForge is build with the developer in mind. so to make it easy to develop i have provided a cli tool that can used to quickly develop it.
```sh
./cli push {folder}             # build & push a single function
./cli push all                  # build & push all functions in the project
./cli invoke {name} ({body})    # run a function locally
./cli list                      # list all functions in the registry
```
